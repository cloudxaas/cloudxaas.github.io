Our mission is to create a bulletproof framework for programming in aerospace military grade software and for artificial intelligence that sets the standard for coding excellence and highest security in code. We recognize that this is a critical need for the aerospace industry, and the world as a whole, and we are committed to doing everything in our power to make it a reality.

To achieve this mission, we are calling on the world's best programmer to join our team and lend their expertise to the creation of this framework. We understand that this is a tall order, but we believe that with the right team, we can make a real difference in the safety and security of our industry.

We are committed to ensuring that every line of code in our framework meets the highest standards of excellence, and is designed with the utmost care and attention to detail. We know that the stakes are high, and that any mistake could have serious consequences, which is why we are committed to doing everything in our power to ensure that our code is as secure and bulletproof as possible.

We believe that this mission is too important to ignore, and that we have a responsibility to use our expertise and resources to create a framework that will protect our industry and our world. We are calling on the world's best programmer to join us in this mission, and to lend their talent and expertise to the creation of a framework that will make a real difference in the safety and security of our industry.

Join us on CloudXaaS, and let's work together to create a bulletproof framework for programming in aerospace military grade software and for artificial intelligence that sets the standard for coding excellence and highest security in code.

Though mainly in the language of golang, c, rust, c++ and javascript, our coding repository is not limited to programming language.

Anything that is mission critical for use in aerospace military software can be used here as well. We strive to meet such high and strigent standard but we will accept what works for now.

version 1.0 will be the highest grade. currently, all development work will be in version 0.0.1
